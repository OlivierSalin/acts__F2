# Acts Common Tracking Software

More information can be found in the [Acts documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/).

## Repository organization

The repository contains all code of the Acts projects, not just the core library
that a physics experiment is expected to use as part of its reconstruction code.
All optional components are disabled by default. Please see the
[getting started guide](docs/getting_started.md) on how-to enable them.

-   `Core/` contains the core library that provides functionality in the `Acts`
    namespace.
-   `Plugins/` contains plugins for core functionality that requires
    additional external packages. The functionality also resides in the `Acts`
    namespace.
-   `Fatras/` provides fast track simulation tools based on the core
    library. This is not part of the core functionality and thus resides in the
    separate `ActsFatras` namespace.
-   `Examples/` contains simulation and reconstruction examples. These are
    internal tools for manual full-chain development and tests and reside in
    the `ActsExamples` namespace.
-   `Tests/` contains automated unit tests, integration tests, and
    (micro-)benchmarks.
-   `thirdparty/` contains external dependencies that are usually not available
    through the system package manager.
